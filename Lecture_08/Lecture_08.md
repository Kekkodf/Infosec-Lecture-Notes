# Answers to the questions of Lecture 08 - Asymmetric Encryption
## 1. Why do we need asymmetric encryption?
Optimization purpuses basically. Supose a user $U$ wants to communicate with $n$ different user. If they use `symmetric encryption`, user $U$ needs $n$ different keys to preserve the confidentiality of the messagges exchanged with the users.

If they use `asymmetric encryption`, to chat with the other users he just need a public key.

With the same encryption sistem $S$ tuple defined in [Lecture_04.md](../Lecture_04/Lecture_04.md):
$$
k\in\mathcal{K} \ \text{private key space}
$$
$$
k'\in\mathcal{K'} \ \text{public key space}
$$
Usually the keys are uniform but not independet, usually the secret key $k$ is selected randomly and uniformally, while $k'=f(k)$.

## 2. Where does secrecy come from in public key encryption?
Secrecy comes from the following statements:
- It is hard to derive $k$ from $k'$.
- It is hard to derive $u$ from $(k',x)$.
- It is hard to derive $k$ from $(u,x)$.

## 3. State the definition of one-way function.
A function $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}$ is a $(\varepsilon_0,T_0;\varepsilon_1, T_1)$-one-way function if:
- $f$ is easy to compute (there exist a probabilistic algorithm that computes $f$ in less than $T_1$ time with probability at least $1-\varepsilon_1$).
- $f$ is hard to invert (there exist a probabilistic algorithm that inverts $f$ in less than $T_0$ time with probability at most $\varepsilon_0$).

## 4. RSA cryptosystem.
`Key generation`
- Choose two large primes $p$ and $q$.
- Compute $n=pq$ and $\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)$.
- Choose $e$ such that $1<e<\phi(n)$ and $gcd(e,\phi(n))=1$.
- Compute $d$ such that $ed\equiv 1\mod\phi(n)$.

<mark>Private key:</mark> $k=(p,q,d)$.

<mark>Public key:</mark> $k'=(n,e)$.

`Encryption`
- Given a message $u\in\mathcal{M}$, compute $x=u^e\mod n$.

`Decryption`
- Given a ciphertext $x\in\mathcal{X}$, compute $u=x^d\mod n$.

`CORRECTNESS`

$$
\hat{u}=x^d=(u^e)^d=u^{ed}=u^{r\phi(n)+1}=u\cdot u^{r\phi(n)}=u\cdot 1=u\mod n
$$
by the Euler theorem.

## 5. El-Gamal cryptosystem.
`Key generation`
- Choose a generator $\alpha$ of a group $\mathbb{G}

<mark>Private key:</mark> $k$ randomly generated by B.

<mark>Public key:</mark> $k'= \alpha^{k}$ computed by B.

`Encryption`

A chooses a random $b\in\mathbb{G}$.
$$
x = (\alpha^b,u\times(k'^{b}))
$$
